# WhiteHat Software Engineer Apprentice Interview Test

## Problem

Using a programming language of your choice, compose a string analysis function that takes two strings as arguments and outputs a report.

The report at a minimum must answer the following questions:
- How many characters are in each string?
- Are the provided strings palindromes*?
- Are the provided strings anagrams of each other**?
- Do any of the provided strings contain numbers?

\* A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backwards as forwards, e.g. "madam" or "nurses run".

** An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once e.g. "debit card" and "bad credit".

### Bonus
Consider adding additional findings to the report, optimising your solution, or providing unit tests.

## Solution

Your solution should be runnable and output a report in the format of your choice.

It should take you no more than a few hours to implement and you will be expected to be able to talk about your solution afterwards.
